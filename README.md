# Swapy

## Introduction
Book readers and video gamers of all ages consume either books or video games on a daily basis.
The project goal is to build a platform that will give a solution for those who wish to exchange their used books / video games with others. 

The project is designed to give a solution for book readers and video gamers who don't have what to do with their books / video games after they finish them – So, instead of leaving it on the shelf to gather dust, they can exchange it and get something valuable for them in return.
The user will upload the book / video game they wish to exchange and another user which interested in his book / video game will propose to exchange with his uploaded library.
